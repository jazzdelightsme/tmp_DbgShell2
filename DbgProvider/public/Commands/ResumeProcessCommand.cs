                        //    breakpoint command.

                        //    to finish. If we want to resume execution from within a
                        //    breakpoint command, we can tell dbgeng to resume, but if we
                        //    then turn around and call WaitForEvent (which is what we
                        //    normally do), then you're deadlocked--WaitForEvent can never
                        //    return, because before dbgeng can let the target resume,
                        //    your breakpoint command has to return, but it can't return

                        //    target resume. We will depend on the "host" (whether it be
